A file management website that brings the benefits of storage to the cloud. Access your files anywhere, at any time.

# Description
Sinkd is the solution to one of the problems most majors at CSUSM face- no centralized storage. Our project gives CSUSM students the ability to access, create folders, upload files, and manage them in a professional way. Users don’t have to worry about losing or wasting time searching for their files. Sinkd allows users to organize and manage files in three easy steps: sign-up, sign-in, and get started. All files are stored in a cloud instead of a local computer. This functionality lets the user access files from anywhere in the world. One of our main focuses was to create a reliable and easy to use application. In today’s world simplicity is the key. Our users don’t have to spend time learning how to use the site. Sinkd is very easy to use, which gives users more power. There are similar platforms like Sinkd, however our product is free, offers limitless storage, and better yet, caters to CSUSM students.
