# Sinkd
Sind is a file management website that brings the benefits of storage to the cloud. Access your files anywhere, at any time.

# Background
Sinkd is the solution to one of the problems most majors at CSUSM face, no centralized storage. Our project gives CSUSM students the ability to access, create folders, upload files, and manage them in a professional way. Users don’t have to worry about losing or wasting time searching for their files. 

Sinkd allows users to organize and manage files in three easy steps: sign-up, sign-in, and get started. All files are stored in a cloud instead of a local computer. This functionality lets the user access files from anywhere in the world. 

One of our main focuses was to create a reliable and easy to use application. In today’s world simplicity is the key. Our users don’t have to spend time learning how to use the site. Sinkd is very easy to use, which gives users more power. There are similar platforms like Sinkd, however our product is free, offers limitless storage, and better yet, caters to CSUSM students.

# Future Enhancements
Some possible future improvements and enhancements we can consider when maintaining the website will be making the site look more professional, and changing the look based on seasons but besides aesthetics, the site does what it's supposed to do and it does it well. Very user friendly and we will keep maintaining it to stay that way and make sure no issues appear. 

Maybe later on we could add a blog on our site where users can give feedback and post their messages on our main page. 

We could also add a search bar to search for any specific file or folder. Sorting options to sort files by format or add account verification to verify accounts upon registering via email. Another possible enhancement would be adding favorites. This way a user could mark a file or folder as their favorite to have quick access to them. 

Another enhancement we could implement is the ability for an admin user with strong permissions to maintain and modify site instead of connecting to the database each time. 

Lastly we could implement a stronger security system. Some implementations are use of strong passwords. One example is to hash the passwords in the database. This way in case of a hack, passwords are not shown in plain text. Another example is to require certain length on each password as well as some numbers or special characters.
